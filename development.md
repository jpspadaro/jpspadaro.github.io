## BASH
I've had a soft spot in my heart for BASH scripting for a long time - I first began using it heavily when I was providing support over SSH for centos-based email security appliances.
## Python
Python is a kind of weird langauge...not [brainf\*ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) level weird, but weird and wonderful. It really lends itself to getting out of the way, and lets the discipline fall in the programmers lap. The [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) sums it up a lot.
### Heroku
#### Places Dark
[Places Dark](https://places-dark.herokuapp.com/) is a procedurally generated text-adventure I've been playing with. I doubt it'll be a polished final product ever, but it's fun to tinker with and expand. It's my first foray into working with Heroku and DJango.

### Fabric
I'm currently transitioning the Mac environment to a combination of [Munki](https://www.munki.org/munki/), MDM, and iPython/Fabric. Fabric in combination with the included json and csv libraries make remote terminal execution a lot smoother than the clunky tools provided by Apple Remote Desktop.
