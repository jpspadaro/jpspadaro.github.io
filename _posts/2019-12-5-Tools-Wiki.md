title: Tools Wiki

I added a ["Tools Wiki"](/git-wiki) today. This is mostly so I can keep running documentation on what I'm using to do certain tasks, especially when I'm setting up a new system. Feel free to browse, and take what you find useful. It's a little sparse right now, but I'm sure it'll fill out over time.
