# Jekyll

As more of my person workflow depends on markdown, I'm finding myself enjoying using it in combination with Jekyll for web.

Also, FYI, [Markor](https://github.com/gsantner/markor) is pretty great as an editor, and the pdf exports are pretty clean. I really need to mess with the style sheet options on this more.
