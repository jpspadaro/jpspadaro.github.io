I've recently started a new online fiction project. Check it out [here.](http://jpspadaro.writeas.com)

I've been playing around with [Write.As](http://write.as) as a blogging platform. It's look is very clean, and minimal. The Fediverse support is also pretty cool, since I've been trying to move away from unfederated social platforms. Freedom of choice and everything.

We'll see how it goes...expect updates as the story continues.
