title: Scraping with a butterknife

Started working on a little web scraping library today. It's pretty minimal at this point, but I'm hoping to broaden it out a bit:

Today is the first time I've worked with [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), and I am pretty impressed. It took me a minute to get a feel for what was producing what, but now I think I'm getting the hang of navigating through the dictionary of output I've been creating in my library.

Next stop: helper functions and objects for common tasks.
