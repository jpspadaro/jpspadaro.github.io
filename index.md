### Printspace3D | ### Heroku
I've written a number of articles covering a variety of topics in 3D printing. These range from a broad view of user-targeted topics to technical documentation. | Developing scalable web applications has been my most recent hobby-project. Currently I'm tinkering with a procedurely generated text adventure written in python using Heroku and Django.
